# Front-End Developer's Assignment
**Simple tasks for checking your frontend development skills.**


### Requirements/perequisites:
* Feel free to use any front-end framework (React, VueJS etc.)
* Layout should be responsive, working both on desktop/ipad/phones.


### Preparation
Please visit https://finanzvergleich.com/kostenloses-girokonto/girokonto-vergleich/ and clone (save locally) the page from a browser. Clean-up all the unnecessary files and codes from the downloaded scripts so that it woulod be easy for you to work. But have to keep the original design, layout and content of the page. Or re-create the page with a front-end framework/ SPA framework by copying the necessary code from the cloned project.


### Task description
1. Fix the missing font of the page (in your cloned version) to complete the design.

2. Get rid of the navigation menu, only keep the logo on the left as it is.

3. There is a filtering option "Kontogebühren" right under the N26 and Comdirect Teaser boxes. From the "Kontogebühren" dropdown list, if “Kostenlose Kontoführung” is selected, currently it shows all the cards. Please show only N26, Comdirect and DKB cards for the “Kostenlose Kontoführung” option selection. No need to change the order of the cards.

4. There is an option “Gemeinschaftskonto möglich” in the dropdown list under the next filtering option "Kontofeature". If “Gemeinschaftskonto möglich” is selected, it doesn’t display the Revolut card. Please show the Revolut card if “Gemeinschaftskonto möglich” is selected. And if both options ("Kostenlose Kontoführung" from Kontogebühren and "Gemeinschaftskonto möglich" from Kontofeature) are selected together, then it should show N26, Comdirect, DKBv and Revolut. Again, no need to change the order of the cards.


**Once completed, submit to your github account and provide us with the link.**

## Have fun!
