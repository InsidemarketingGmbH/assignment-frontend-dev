# Front-End Developer's Assignment
**Objective: This assignment aims to assess your front-end development skills through a simple task.**


### Requirements/prerequisites:
* Feel free to use any front-end framework, but ReactJS is preferred.
* The layout should be responsive, working on Desktops/Tablets/mobiles.


### Preparation
Please visit https://finanzvergleich.com/kreditkarte/kreditkarten-vergleich/ and clone the page using a tool like https://www.httrack.com/ or from your browser directly to have the page assets locally in your machine where you'll do the development.


### Task description
1. Re-create the page with a front-end SPA framework (React/Vue/Angular) by getting the code elements, images, and icons from the cloned project.

2. There will be the site font missing in your cloned version, hence inspect the font on the live page https://finanzvergleich.com/kreditkarte/kreditkarten-vergleich/ and update the missing font of the cloned page to complete the design of your recreated page.

**Once completed, submit it to your GitHub account and provide us with the link.**

## Have fun!
