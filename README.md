# Front-End Developer's Assignment
**A simple task for checking your frontend development skills.**


### Requirements/perequisites:
* Feel free to use any front-end framework (React, VueJS etc.)
* Layout should be responsive, working both on desktop/ipad/phones.


### Preparation
Please visit https://finanzvergleich.com/kostenloses-girokonto/girokonto-vergleich/ and clone the page from a browser. Clean-up all the unnecessary files and codes from the downloaded scripts so that it woulod be easy for you to work. But have to keep the original design, layout and content of the page. Or re-create the page with a front-end framework/ SPA framework by copying the necessary code from the cloned project.


### Task description
1. Fix the missing font of the page to complete the design.

2. Get rid of the navigation menu, only keep the logo on the left as it is.

3. There is a filtering option "Kontogebühren" right under the DKB and Comdirect Teaser boxes. From the "Kontogebühren" dropdown list, if “Kostenlose Kontoführung” is selected, currently it shows DKB, Comdirect and N26 cards. Please show all the cards for the “Kostenlose Kontoführung” option selection. Don't change the order of the cards.

4. There is an option “Gemeinschaftskonto möglich” in the dropdown list under the next filtering option "Kontofeature". If “Gemeinschaftskonto möglich” is selected, it doesn’t display the DKB card. Please also show the DKB card if “Gemeinschaftskonto möglich” is selected. Again, don't change the order of the cards.


**Once completed, submit to your github account and provide us with link.**

## Have fun!
